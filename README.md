# SISA
To run the current records for Vision Model, WGAN, LSTM and Data Heterogeneity, run the following commands for the set up:

```bash
conda env create -f vision_tasks.yml
```
The set up for other tasks will be sepcified in their corresponding folders.

All LLM experiments are conducted on four NVIDIA H100-80GB GPUs, while all other experiments run on a single such GPU.
